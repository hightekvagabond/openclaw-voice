# Environment Requirements File - EXAMPLE TEMPLATE
# 
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: This is an EXAMPLE template file.
# To use the secrets management system, you MUST:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.requirements in your project root
# 2. Modify the variables to match your project's needs
# 3. Remove any example variables you don't need
#
# This file declares what environment variables are required for this project.
# It serves as documentation and is used by the credential management system.
#
# FORMAT:
# - Use #*# comments to describe each variable (on the line immediately before)
# - Leave the value empty (VARIABLE=) - actual values come from other sources
# - This file is committed to git and shared with all developers
#
# EXAMPLES (modify these for your project):

#*# Database connection string for the application backend
DATABASE_URL=""

#*# API key for external service integration (e.g., payment processor)
PAYMENT_API_KEY=""

#*# AWS access key ID for S3 bucket operations
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""

#*# AWS secret access key (companion to AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID)
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""

#*# GitHub personal access token for API operations
GITHUB_TOKEN=""

#*# Example default variable for testing
DEFAULT_VAR="This is a default var"

# USAGE:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.requirements in your project root
# 2. Add your required variables above using the #*# format
# 3. Remove example variables you don't need
# 4. Run the project - you'll be prompted to configure sources for each variable
# 5. Your source preferences are saved in .dev-prefs/env-source.json
# 6. Variables are automatically available in the DevContainer
#
# SECURITY:
# - This system only exposes the variables you list here
# - No full credential file mounting (more secure than mounting ~/.aws, ~/.ssh, etc.)
# - Each developer configures their own credential sources
# - The .env.requirements file is committed to git (contains no secrets, only variable names)
# - Actual secret values are fetched from secure sources (Bitwarden, AWS profiles, etc.)
